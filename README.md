This is a small MAUI (xaml) cross-platform utility to learn foreing language words.

<h1>How it works.</h1>
You just put in a word and a description, and a card appears.
On the practice page you can filter out cards by level, tag and dates, and see the words on the front side. 

Initially you see the word, and you either know it already or not.
Pressing "I know!" button progresses the card through leves from bronze to diamond.
Turning the card over, on the other hand, reveals the description, but it also means that you haven't yet learned the word and the card level is dropped down to "Bronze"

On the tags page it is possible to manage tags for cards grouping.
All information is stored locally at the moment, using SQLite DB.
